description: Instructions for Developing with Caffenol
---

### Ingredients

The recipe I use is straight out of the [Caffenol Bible]().

* 54g/l Washing Soda (it says water free, but I couldn't get my hands on any, instead they recommend 2.7x this amount for washing soda crystals)
* 16g/l Vitamin C (I used chewable orange flavoured tablets - not recommended)
* 1g/l Potassium Bromide (I used iodised salt because I saw someone else use it in a youtube video)
* 40g/l Instant Coffee Powder

### Instructions

1. The ingredients above are for 1 litre. So I used half the amount to make a batch of 500ml for my development tank.
2. They also recommend to make the solution in two parts, one for the soda and another for the coffee. This is so that you can see when both are completely dissolved (the darkness of the coffee powder makes it really hard to see the soda).
3. The bible recommends a 15 minute develop time, 10 inversions in the first minute, 3 every minute after.
4. Then stop and fix normally. I just rinsed with water for my stop bath (I saw others do this). And I used Ilford Rapid Fixer at a ration of 1+4 to fix the film.
5. Then lots of rinsing and hanging up in my shower to dry.
