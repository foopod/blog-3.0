## Your camera

The type of camera you use does make a difference, but it is more about preference than anything. Some like the intimacy and rawness of a range finder, while others appreciate the accuracy of an SLR. Only hipsters use TLRs (waist level viewfinders). Note that this guide is for people with cameras like the above. A lot of point and shoot cameras will not give you the option to change some of the settings we are going to talk about. This doesn't mean that you will not get anything out of this guide, but you may be limited by your camera.

Do some research about the kind of camera you have. You need to feel comfortable and confident using it.

ACTION -> Go find the manual for your camera online. Figure out what each button does.


## Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO

### Exposure

We will go through aperture, shutter speed and ISO in detail in this chapter. But most important is what they all have in common. They each have an effect on the amount of light that ends up in your camera i.e. the exposure. 

They all have other effects too, but it is important to note this one.

The camera might have tools built in that could help get that perfect exposure. Some will have a lightmeter built in and tell you to compensate with more or less light. Others will have a "dumb" lightmeter that just offers an EV (Exposure Value). This will mean you have to do all the work in figuring out the correct settings using a table like below.

![EV Table]

If your camera has no lightmeter or if it does not work (not uncommon in older cameras), then you can download an app on your phone that will do the same thing, or look into purchasing a handheld lightmeter. The lightmeter will help you choose the right camera settings for the light available.

Too much? Keep reading... It gets easier I promise.

### Aperture

Aperture is how wide the opening in the lens is. This is shown in f stops like f/2. It can be confusing at first because low numbers like f/2 represent quite a wide aperture, whereas high numbers like f/22 are a smaller aperture.

A handy way to think of this is by saying that f is your lens and if you divide it by a big number then it gets quite small. Like f/22 is like saying that your lens lets through 1/22 of the light.

Adjusting aperture allows you to control the depth of field, in other words how deep the area is that is in focus.

> *Depth of field varies with how deep the focus is too. The depth of field when focus close to the camera is very shallow, but the further you focus the wider it gets.*

Here are some examples of situations where you might want to vary the aperture.

If you shoot a person with anywhere between f/1.2 to f/2.8 the background would be quite blurry. This would attract the viewers attention to the person and help them stand out in the photograph.

>*If the background is very close to the viewer though for example a brick wall right behind them, then it will probably still be quite sharp. This is because as an object leaves the field of view the blur will increase the further away it gets.*

Another situation might be for a group of people, this could be taken at a narrower aperture, say f/5.6, f/8 or even smaller. This expands the depth of field and it makes it easier to get everyone's faces in focus even though they might all be at different distances from the camera.

ACTION -> Figure out how to change the aperture on your camera. Is it on the lens? Or on the camera body? Can you change the aperture? Even if you do not have your camera on you while you are reading this, look it up on your phone and figure out how to change the aperture.


### Shutter Speed

The shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter is open, letting light into the camera. The longer it is open the more light will get in. Shutter speed is measured in seconds and fractions of a second. For example, on a bright day you would probably use a faster shutter speed than if you are shooting at night.

The longer the shutter is open the more information about a scene the camera is picking up. If an object in the scene is moving then the camera is seeing it move. But because we are taking a single photograph the way we see that movement is through motion blur.

This is important to consider if you are hand holding your camera. No one's hands are steady enough to use shutter speeds like 1/5 of a second and the result is the whole image might be a bit blurry (this is called camera shake).

> *One way to counter camera shake is to try to always use a shutter speed of 1/focal length. So if you are using a 50mm lens you should try to stay at or above 1/50 seconds shutter speed, or if you are using a big 300mm lens you should go up to 1/300. This is because the more your camera zooms the more impact a small movement will have on the final image (this is why telescopes are always on tripods, a tiny movement and you are looking at a totally different galaxy).*

The opposite end of the scale is using much longer shutter speeds. This is useful to compensate your exposure in dark situations, like shooting glow worms in a cave. This is often called a long exposure. By using longer shutter speeds, you can capture movement in really creative ways. Some examples might be recording star trails or blurring waves, water and clouds to create wispy whimsical photographs. But for these kind of photos, you will almost definitely need a tripod or at least something steady to put your camera on.

ACTION -> Figure out how to change the shutter speed. If you do not have any film loaded then try to shoot with it and see if you can hear the difference in sound at a high and low shutter speed. Note you may not be able to fire the shutter without film loaded on some cameras.


### ISO - Exposure Sensitivity

ISO is a standard for how sensitive your film is to light. Digital cameras have sensors that can adjust sensitivity using software, whereas film cameras have different speeds (ISO) of film that can be used.

> *e.g. Kodak Ektar is a 100 ISO film and Kodak Portra is 400 ISO.*

Being able to change the ISO is very handy. It means that we can use a variety of aperture and shutter speeds we would not be able to otherwise. For example in darker conditions if we are using a 3200 ISO, we can still probably use a higher shutter speed letting us freeze the motion of something moving fast. This could be great for photography at a concert or similar.

Unfortunately using a highly sensitive medium has its drawbacks. High ISO film will usually produce more grain in your photos. However, this is stylistically preferential in some cases.

Slow films have very fine grain and thus are used by professionals for photographs to be printed.


### Camera Modes

Aperture, shutter speed and ISO all work together to create the final image. For this reason two of the most common modes on cameras are aperture priority and shutter priority modes. In these modes the camera lets you focus on one setting, like aperture and then the camera will use it's built in lightmeter to figure out what the other will be.

> *For example you are trying to get a photo of your friend throwing a bunch of leaves in the air. You want to catch the motion. If you use Shutter Priority mode, you can choose the Shutter Speed you think will work and then the camera will pick the right aperture to make sure the exposure looks right.*

There are a bunch of different modes your camera might have...

+ Shutter Priority - Set the shutter speed and aperture will be chosen automatically to correct the exposure.
+ Aperture Priority - Set the aperture and the shutter speed will be chosen automatically to correct the exposure.
+ Automatic - Everything is done for you. A lot of point and shoots fit this category and will have a fixed aperture, they will just change shutter speed to correct exposure (some will have a flash too).
+ Manual - You have set the aperture and shutter speed.

ACTION -> Does your camera have aperture priority or shutter priority mode? Maybe both? Or neither. Do not worry if it does not, a lot of older ones do not.


### How does it work in practice?

Below are some examples of photos with the settings that they were shot at and an aspect that you might want to change about them. Your challenge is to figure out how the settings could be changed to get the effect you desire.

1. Photo of car with motion blur, the rest of the scene is crisp. You wanted to freeze the motion of the car. ISO=800 SS=1/25 A=f/5.6
2. Portrait photograph, clearly out of focus. ISO=200 SS=1/200 A=f/1.8
3. Sunset photograph, the whole scene is motion blurred. ISO=200 SS=1/5 A=f/1.2
4. Group of people, one in focus. ISO=200 SS=1/250 A=f/1.2


> Answers are at the end of the book.

1. Make the shutterspeed faster. In this photo you might be able to use the Aperture to compensate. So perhaps something like SS=1/100 A=f/2. For this it might also be handy to use Shutter Priority.
2. Okay. This one was a trick. The settings are fine, but the shot just isn't in focus. Hopefully you can distinguish the difference between blur because of focus and blur because of motion. 
3. Looks like we were holding the camera with our hands and the shutter speed means that our shaky hands make motion blur appear. We could come back with some faster film (faster means higher ISO), something like 800 to help with this, but the higher we go the more noise we will introduce. The best option is likely to be using a tripod to keep the camera steady when shooting at such a slow shutter speed.
4. This one can be fixed by using a smaller aperture. Maybe something like f/2.8 or f/5.6. This way the depth of field will be deeper and more of the image will be in focus. Note that this will need to be compensated though, this can be done through any combination of ISO and shutter speed. So maybe something like ISO=400 and SS=1/100.

## Composition

Personally, composition has been the hardest thing for me to grasp (in that I am still learning). Everything up until this point has been mostly technical, but this is where you can get really creative.

Over time, people have created guides and tools to help with composition. Generally you can use them to make a bad photo better, but these alone will not create masterpieces. I have found that with experience you kind of train your eye to look out for good compositions.
    
I also recommend watching other photographers shoot and observing how they compose their shots. This could be at meetups, Youtube videos or trying to tag along with people you know.

### Rule of Thirds

You know how you can turn on a 3x3 grid on your digital camera? Well that is to help you compose your image. As the name suggests this rule tells us to place three imaginary thirds meaningfully in our image.

> e.g. When shooting a sunset this might mean composing your image in this way. With the bottom third being the ocean, the middle third being clear sky and the top third holding the sun and the clouds.

> e.g. This could also apply to a portrait shot. Perhaps the right most third has someone's head shot in profile looking left, the middle frame is a corner building on the street and the left-most frame looks down the street into the distance.

![Add images here]

Action -> Put your camera up to your eye and try to imagine these gridlines. Line them up with whatever is in front of you and get a feel for what it looks like. If you want to explore this a bit further, try looking at some photos you have already taking and cropping them so that they fit the rule of thirds. Do they look better or worse? The rule of thirds isn't a silver bullet, but a useful tool for your kit.

### Leading Lines

Another way images can be composed is by using naturally occurring lines in your image to draw the eyes in. This is based on the idea that if someone is stuck looking at your image for even a few hundred milliseconds it has caught their attention and stands out from the crowd. 

This is most commonly talked about in landscape photography, where the natural landscape plays a large part, but can also be seen a lot in street and portrait photography.

> e.g. A photo looking down a canyon towards a waterfall, the viewers eyes are drawn down the canyon wall to rest on the waterfall.

![Add images here]

Action -> Do a quick online search for landscape photographs and see if you can recognise leading lines in five of them. Do you think that leading lines makes a big difference to the photographs?

### Other Techniques

+ **Different Perspectives** - You can use unusual angles to draw viewers in. Some examples might be shooting from above with a drone, from a security camera in the corner of a room or simply from the floor looking up at your subject.
+ **Negative Space** - Be purposeful about what makes it into your shot. Does your subject go right to the edge? Or perhaps you are using negative space to show motion? Maybe something else?
+ **Don't cut off limbs** - If you are doing portrait photography do not cut off limbs at the joints. If you are going to crop from a headshot then cut above or below the shoulders. Maybe it is a medium shot, make sure not to cut them off at the elbows or wrist joints.
+ **Foreground Interest** - By using a narrow aperture, you can capture detail in the foreground as well as your subject in the background.
+ **Symmetry** - Abstract and architecture photography often use symmetry to create interesting photographs.

Action -> Pick one of the above that interests you. Load some film into your camera. Go outside and shoot.

## Post Production

This is definitely more of a read if you are curious section. For me the reason I shoot film is because of how hands on and mindful the process is beginning to end. For others it might the feel of a manual camera, or the WYSIWYG nature of film. All of the below is totally optional and can be done by a film development studio.

### Developing Film

#### How does film work?

Your camera is essentially a carrier of film, a piece of very thin plastic coated in a gel emulsion that holds silver crystals. When you take a photo the light that hits the film causes a chemical reaction in these silver halide crystals. The more light that hits the crystals the stronger this reaction is. This forms what is called the latent image.

When you develop the film the silver haildes turn to metallic silver, which blocks the light and is therefore visibly black on the negatives. The fixer is then used to remove any remaining silver halide crystals, this stops any further exposure.

#### The process to develop film

You might not get into developing film immediately when you start with the hobby. And I probably would recommend starting by sending your film to a reputable company to start, even if it is just so you have something to compare your negatives too when you start developing yourself.

Some things that are important to note is that different films require different chemicals and different processes to develop. This is another good reason to send it off in the beginning, you can try all the film and find out what you like before getting all the chemicals. The main three are colour (c-41), slide (e-6) and black & white. Prices are all fairly similar with the exception of slide film, it seems to be a dying art and there are few places that develop or stock the chemicals.

To get started there is other equipment that you will need too..

+ **A development tank** - This is a light proof container that holds your film and you can pour liquids into and out of.
+ **A darkroom, windowless bathroom or a changing bag** - You also need a light proof way of getting the film into the development tank.
+ **A timer** - To measure how long film should fit in chemicals.
+ **A thermometer** - This depends on the development process, some need high temperature accuracy.
+ **Bottles/Measuring containers** - For mixing and storing chemicals. Light proof bottles that you can squeeze the air out of are perfect.
+ **Scissors** - For snipping film.


The process itself though is quite simple (note that I will describe black & white - colour is very similar, but slide requires a few extra steps).

1. Load your film into the development tank (normally one roll of 120 or two 35s). This is done in the changing bag so that the film is not exposed to any more light.
2. Prepare your chemicals according to their instructions. They normally come as either powders or concentrates that are dissolved in water.  This should be done right before you develop, but there are certain chemicals that have a good shelf life after they are mixed (like most fixers). Some chemicals will also be required to be at certain temperatures.
3. Soak your film. Most processes can be helped along by letting the film soak in some water for a few minutes before you get started.
4. Develop your film. Pour the developer in for the specified time and agitate as per developer instructions. In regards to agitation, some will use the handles on dev tanks for rotational agitation and others will invert the whole container. See what works for you.
5. Rinse the developer off your film quickly by filling the dev tank with water, sloshing it around and then tipping it out.
6. Then you can optionally rinse with photoflow or water with a couple drops of dishwashing liquid. This helps it dry withoot any water marks.
7. Hang your film up in a dust free place and let it dry overnight. You can run hot water in your shower and hang it up there. The steam will make sure there is no dust in the air.
8. Snip them up and put your negatives in sleeves.

There are alternatives to some traditional chemicals though, for example there are several recipes available online for making a black and white film developer out of instant coffee, vitamin c and bicarbonate soda. This can be fun to experiment with while you are learning and actually does a pretty decent job.

### Scanning Film

You can save a lot of money scanning your film yourself rather than paying someone else to do it. There are a few different techniques that make it more accessible.

All of the below will work for 35mm or 120mm.

+ **Negative Scanner** - A scanner built specifically to scan film. You can get an entry model quite cheaply (the cheap ones will only do 35mm). Film processing shops will use a professional scanner that is mostly automatic and will do high resolution scans. 
+ **Flatbed Scanner** - If you already have a scanner at home, you can use a normal consumer scanner. But depending on the model, the resolution can be quite poor.
+ **DSLR Scanning** - If you have a DSLR and a lens setup that lets you focus quite closely, you can use this to scan your negatives. This will work really well with a macro lens and a negative holder to keep them flat.

If you already have any of the equipment above then give it a go and see how it turns out. Compare it to what your local shop can do, this might be good enough for you in the beginning. Or for posting to instagram.

### Printing your Photos

Almost everything that applied to development in the previous section applies here as well. That is because the process is the same, you expose some light sensitive medium and then develop and fix.

Some extra equipment is needed though...

+ **A dark room** - Or a bathroom without windows, somewhere you can make totally dark.
+ **An enlarger** - kind of like a projector, but for negatives. You also need holders for the size of negative you are printing from.
+ **Development trays** - large plastic trays that will hold your chemicals and allow whatever size paper you are printing to lie flat.
+ **A safe light** - this is a special red light that only emits a spectrum of light that the photographic paper won't expose under. Tt also means that you can see in your dark room.
+ **A timer** - you do need to be quite precise when printing.


The process essentially involves using an enlarger with a lens to project your photograph onto photographic paper. The light exposes the paper as it would film and because this process reverses the negative you end up with a positive of the image.

There are also a few pretty cool things you can do when printing...

+ **You can make contact prints** - Take a whole page of negatives and lie them on the photographic paper with a piece of glass on top to hold them flat. Then expose and develop. Now you can the reversals of all of your negatives. A lot of photographers will do this for every roll, it is great for reference and choosing what photo to print. You can keep them in the same folder as your negatives so you can find things easily. 
+ **You can try cyanotype printing** - A bit more experimental, this uses different chemicals to normal printing. However you can paint the chemicals on anything, this means that you can print on anything. The process can also be more time consuming. The finished prints will also have a blue hue to them because of the chemicals used.
+ **You can make photograms** - Try putting something other than negatives between the light and the photographic paper. You can try things that have interesting shapes, or things that are partially transparent. Or include negatives in the image as well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*What camera should I get?*

I can't answer this for you. I can give some advice though.

+ The best camera is the one you have on you. If it is too big or heavy, too cumbersome to set up then you are not going to be as likely to use it or take it with you.
+ Try before you buy as much as possible, ask friends, rent expensive cameras/lenses if you can before spending the a lot of money.

*Why does my photo look like 'x'?*

Remember how we talked about Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO? Well before you take the photo it can be really good to think about these. For example, is the photo going to be blurry? Is it because of the focus or is it motion blur? If it is motion blur, is there room to open the aperture up a little so you can make the shutter speed faster? Or is it just too dark? Maybe a tripod would have helped?

It is all about tradeoffs and the fastest way to learn these is to analyze the photos that you have taken and think about how to make them better.

*How could I make this photo better?*

Find a way to get feedback. There are numerous ways to do this, but the easiest way I know of is through online forums. My personal favourite is [r/photocritique](https://www.reddit.com/r/photocritique/) (be sure to read the rules of the subreddit for maximum value of feedback).

*Can I travel with film? Will the x-rays ruin my photos?*

There are mixed reviews around this. I have generally never had a problem, even putting film in checked in luggage. I have also heard accounts from airport security officers that modern film is nowhere near as vulnerable to x-rays as stuff from 50 years ago.

When you think about it though, film gets shipped all across the globe before it gets to you. It must have been through x-rays already anyway and probably stronger ones used in commercial transport.

*Is film photography expensive?*

Yes. It can be. But there are lots of things you can do to reduce your costs.

+ Look around for bulk or expired film.
+ Develop your own film. Even with start up costs you will make your money back within 10 rolls.
+ Scan your own film.
+ Find people that do the above in your area, things are more fun and always cheaper if you do them together. You can split bulk rolls and development costs.


## Things to do next..

+ If you don't already have a favourite photographer, go find one!
+ Don't buy any new gear! Whatever you have is probably enough to get started (yes, even if it is your phone). If you want a film camera, go to your local second hand store and see if you can find a working camera for cheap.
+ Find people to learn from, look for meetup groups, instagrammers in your area (if you like their stuff) or go further afield.
+ Practice with purpose. This is often overlooked, but you can take a ton of photos without really thinking. I made this mistake too when I started. When you go out, know what you want to bring home.
e.g. Where do you want to improve? Composition. What kind of photo do you want to take? A swan on a lake with the background completely blurred. What do you need to do this? Maybe your tripod, you will need to get the camera as close to water level as possible so that you don't have too much water around the bird. This is so you that the background behind the bird is far away and thus out of focus.
