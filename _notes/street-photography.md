Street Photography. It's not that scary.

And just like every other aspect of photography you can make it your own.

You can focus on the environment..

Or on people..

You can set up your composition and wait

Or you can walk and shoot

You can get up close and personal

Or you can shoot from afar

You can talk to your subjects and ask for them to pose for you,

Or you can take your photos discretely

There is one rule though. And this is important...

HAVE FUN!
