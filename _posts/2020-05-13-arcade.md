title: Building an Arcade for Mother's Day

This is something I have been wanting to do ever since I got my first Raspberry Pi while I was in University. I ordered the buttons, the joystick and a bunch of other bits and pieces, but I never really got my shit together.

This brings us to last week. Mother's Day was coming, I'm in lockdown and the postal service is backed up at least 2 weeks. Now my mum doesn't play video games, at least in the traditional sense. But when she was growing up she was addicted to the game Space Invaders. So I decided to build her an Arcade Machine.

Now when you are giving someone an Arcade Machine and you haven't told them that, it might not be the best idea to build them a full-size cabinet. So with that in mind I settled on something smaller that would plug into her existing TV.

I wanted the layout to be simple and easy to use, but at the same time I wanted her to be able to play a wide range of games. So I settled on a 4 button layout with a Start and Select button at the top.

Also this is probably an important time to note that we are using a Raspberry Pi 1B, this is actually the RPi I received 8 years ago while I was in Uni. So I was limited somewhat by the emulators that will run well on this. But you could do this with any Raspberry Pi (even the Zero).

After a little testing I found that Gameboy, Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance are probably a good way to go. I am familiar with the emulators and played the games a lot growing up. There is a really good selection of retro games like Asteroids, Space Invaders and Tetris. And a lot of Modern Games on GBA that work really well too, this is also why I chose a 4 button layout over 2 buttons.

On to the build. I went simple and cheap by only using things I had lying around.

+ Raspberry Pi 1B
+ Scrap Plywood to make the majority of the case
+ Scrap Acrylic for the bottom (I ran out of plywood, and also this looks hella cool)
+ 3M Foam Tape (leftover from when I built my quadcopter, which I crashed and sold)
+ Buttons and Arcade Stick (that I bought but never used)
+ Adafruit Breakout for RPi (again, bought years ago, but never used)
+ Random wires, a combination of solid core and old speaker cables.
+ Spare HDMI Cable and Micro USB Cable

 The build was pretty easy for me, but me 8 years ago would have struggled. If this looks like a daunting task for you, then I highly recommend finding a local makerspace or a friend with a workshop. One of those accepts cash, the other might accept beer.

I have included a diagram, but all the wiring is super simple. One side of every switch is connected to ground, the other connected to it's own GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi. This is also a great time to mention that arcade style joysticks are really easy to use, they are just 4 switches. Up, Down, Left and Right. Super simple.

I installed [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/) on the RPi's SD Card and followed [this guide](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/First-Installation/) to set up my games.

And I used Adafruit's awesome little piece of software to easily map the buttons and joystick to keyboard keys. Check [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/retro-gaming-with-raspberry-pi/adding-controls-software) out for how to install and set it up.

And it works! The joystick is pretty satisfying, highly recommend.
