description: I learn how to invert a film negative

I have been going through my photos and found one that missed the scanner. Why not try to scan it myself?

I borrowed a DSLR and took the best shitty photo I could.

Then using photoshop I used the Eyedropper tool inside Image > Adjustments > Levels to set the white point and the black point of the image.

Then just invert the image and BAM!
