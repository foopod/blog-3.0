Look at this beauty!

The Yashica 35 M is now the oldest camera I own, from 1973 it's more than twice as old as I am.

It shows its age in how you use it. It has a lightmeter on the front that I thought was a flash hahaha. It uses Selenium, a chemical, to measure the light rather than the more modern silicon semiconductors.

The lightmeter displays a number on top of the camera telling me what the EVS (exposure value scale)is, so that I can choose an appropriate aperture and shutter speed myself.

The other noticeable difference with this camera is that it's a rangefinder. Sadly the viewfinder is not very visible and makes focussing this camera difficult.

And look! It's me. Also, the self timer on this thing is mechanical. It's pretty cool to hear the ticking and winding as it counts down.
