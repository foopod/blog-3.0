description: Day 1. How did I get here? What now?
---

About 8 months ago I bought my first serious camera while I was in Tokyo, Japan. It was a Canon AE-1 Film camera. Gorgeous. This and the months that followed really opened my eyes to the world of photography.

Now I am sitting here with my first digital camera writing this post thinking... "what if I actually did this for real?"

So this is it.

Day 1.
