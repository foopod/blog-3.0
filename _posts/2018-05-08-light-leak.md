It turns out the camera I purchased has a light leakðŸ˜”. Which means that all the photos I took in Japan look like this. I mean it's pretty cool, but got a bit frustrating looking through 72 of them.

Not pro at photoshop enough to fix this (yet). 

But I figured out how to desaturate the image and play with the brightness & contrast to salvage some of the photos.
