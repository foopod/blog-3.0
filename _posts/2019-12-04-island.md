description: Using Perlin Noise to Procedurally Generate Islands

So I saw another cool post by someone that was generating islands and I wanted to give it a go.

Since I haven't really used three.js for anything before I thought it would be a good way to learn that too.

Starting out by using Perlin noise to generate some terrain, there were tons of examples of this and three.js had one on their [site](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=terr#webgl_geometry_terrain).

Then once I had that working I had to shape it into an island. After looking around for some ideas I finished up borrowing a technique from [here](https://jobtalle.com/layered_voxel_rendering.html). I essentially create a dome and multiply it with my terrain I generated in the first step.

This is the result...

Next I use the height of each part of the island to determine what colour the vertices should be.

Add some finishing touches and boom!
