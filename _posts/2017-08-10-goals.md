Goals are important right? To be successful we need to know what success means.

Defining goals within an organisation is difficult, because goals need to be aligned with strategy. But they also need to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic and Time-Based) right?

There are also different types of goals that you could have...

+ Are your goals based around an **outcome**? Like for example hitting a 40% app retention rate.
+ Maybe they are **performance** goals? Like delivering all of the scope on budget and within the time frame.
+ Are they based on **processes**? Like ensuring quality code, collaborating with customers or maybe continuous delivery.

There are trade offs in all of this though. It is easy to link outcome based goals to strategy, but hard to see and plan exactly how they will be achieved. Process goals are focused, but they may fail to motivate, would you rather celebrate an extra 3% code coverage or being 20% up on app usage?

How do you set your goals?
