Decided to have a jam with black & white (b&w) film once I fixed up the light leak.

Did a bunch of research first and found that most people recommend overexposing the film by a stop to add contrast (we will learn why later).

This first shot came out awesome. I love the expression on my mum's face as she stares into the distance waiting for that first cup of coffee to arrive.

This second one though, is a little disappointing. Athena was in a joyous yellow dress and in the background a red stone path weaves through the green grass. There would have been plenty of contrasting colours to seperate Athena from the background. But alas, in b&w she blends into the grass behind her.

Shooting b&w is difficult because you don't know how it will turn out until you get it developed. Or at least until you learn to compose based on brightness rather than colour.
