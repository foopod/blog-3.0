<p>As of now Homage is free.</p><p>It took me most of the afternoon to decide whether to do it. I figure that no matter how this turns out it will have been a good learning experience. The app now has ads and more specifically ad settings, users can turn ads off entirely, use ads as rewards or see ads at the end of every game.</p><p>Most importantly though, the game is now free, this is opens it up to a much larger audience of players that would otherwise not pay for the game. Instead I can make money off them in advertising (hopefully).</p><p>Admittedly this has all been very rushed, hopefully it all goes well.</p><p>Go download it!Â <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foopod.homage" target="_blank">Homage on Google Play</a></p><p>Later days.</p>
