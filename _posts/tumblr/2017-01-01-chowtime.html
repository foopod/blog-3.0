<p>So the other day I saw a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13265723" target="_blank">HN post</a> about an app to help people fast, this intrigued me because in the past I have attempted intermittent fasting (for those unfamiliar with the term here is a <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/intermittent-fasting-diets-are-gaining-acceptance/?_r=0" target="_blank">linky poo</a>) and failed miserably. What could this app offer?</p><figure data-orig-width="630" data-orig-height="630" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oj4biqTpkJ1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="630" data-orig-height="630"/></figure><p>Sadly the app was iOS only and listed features on the App Store was not very descriptive. So I thought about what I would want in an app to help me fast and as a game dev the first thing that came to my mind was gamification. I also wanted&hellip;</p><ul><li>Easy to export data<br/></li><li>A quick glance at how I am doing throughout the day<br/></li><li>Super easy mechanism to stop and start</li></ul><p>I had also seen a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5l39mu/my_daughters_sleeping_patterns_for_the_first_4/" target="_blank">post on reddit</a> that used the data from when his daughter was awake/sleeping to make a really cool visualization.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1536" data-orig-height="1536" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oj4c21Rd0j1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1536" data-orig-height="1536"/></figure><p>The image shows one continuous spiral around from the inside when his daughter was born, each revolution represents a single day (midnight at the top). I thought that this would be a cool way to express the data I was creating.</p><p>When I approached this my two options (well for fast development) were Unity3d and HTML5. Unity seemed like overkill for this project, but I was concerned about storing data when making an offline HTML5 app.</p><p>Unfortunately across browsers there is no guarantee of persistent data, a user can very easily delete their webapp data by accident clearing their browser cache. In the end I decided that as long as the user knows this flaw it wouldn’t be too bad and this method negates the need for server-side infrastructure or a bloated app. Were there other ways to achieve this? Probably lots, I had thought about wrapping the app in something like Cordova, but that came with its own downsides.</p><p>So <a href="https://chowtime.pw/" target="_blank">this</a> is it. I called the app chowtime because I am a hilarious human being and no one can take that from me. There are a few features I am thinking about adding still that might improve it, but otherwise I am pretty happy with it.</p><p>Like&hellip;</p><ul><li>Setting goals for time that you aren’t eating.<br/></li><li>Editing existing data in case you pressed the button by accident or forgot to press it.<br/></li><li>Adding a visualization to the the app.</li></ul><figure data-orig-width="930" data-orig-height="1094" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oj4dajQB4t1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="930" data-orig-height="1094"/></figure><p>Thanks for reading! Stay cool!</p>
