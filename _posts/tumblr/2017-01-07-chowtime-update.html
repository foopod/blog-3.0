<p>I have been working on Chowtime quite a bit and it is proving to be pretty handy for what I needed.</p><p>In the last week I have</p><ul><li>Added a tool to visualize your eating habits.<br/></li><li>Revamped the UI to make it a little more intuitive.</li><li>Enabled Web App features.<br/></li><li>Moved to a hosting provider with Lets Encrypt integration.</li></ul><p><b>Visualization</b></p><p>I got around to creating the tool I was talking about in the last blog post.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1402" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ojfsh4xdWf1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1402"/></figure><p>The largest most outer ring is today and each successive ring going inwards are previous days. I really like this as it shows a lot of information in an intuitive way, but it was a pain in the butt to make and still doesn’t support fasting periods of more than 24 hours. So I want to fix that, but also add a log where someone can see any extra information they have added using the experimental diary feature.</p><p><b>New UI</b></p><p>The toggle button was beginning to annoy me, with the diary feature the button had up to 3 functions which was not intuitive at all. Now you simply click the panda to toggle eating and not eating, the diary has its own submit button and the experiments now use a much nicer toggle button.</p><figure data-orig-width="856" data-orig-height="1359" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ojfsunwYRu1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="856" data-orig-height="1359"/></figure><p>As you can see above it is way easier to get to the visualization, in the past it was buried in the FAQ. The next step might be to embed the visualization into this page so you don’t have to move back and forth. The button to export is still hidden in the FAQ though, but I feel like that is fine because users don’t need it very often.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1914" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ojft4anoYt1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1914"/></figure><p><b>Web App</b></p><p>So to give the best experience possible for mobile users I added meta tags to allow for Chowtime to function as a web app. It was actually super simple and below shows just how easy it is to support Android and iOS.</p><figure data-orig-width="1562" data-orig-height="340" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ojft9p6sNs1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1562" data-orig-height="340"/></figure><p>This basically means that users can add it to their homescreen and it will function similarly to a native app. It will have a lovely app icon and launch nicely with a splash screen and no browser bar. Yay!</p><p><b>New Hosting</b></p><p>Google Chrome will actually recommend users to add the web app to the homescreen if it meets a few simple requirements. One of them is to have a service worker registered for the app and to have it served over https. But unfortunately Github Pages does not support SSL for custom domains.</p><p>Enter Netlify. Netlify supports HTTPS for custom domains, has integrated Lets Encrypt and allows easy CI from a github repo. It’s all so simple and totally free for prototyping. I am sure performance doesn’t live up to the SSDs of Digital Ocean, but it does the job and I haven’t noticed any especially slow load times. Although I might run some performance tests now that I have the same web app on both GH Pages and Netlify.</p><p>Either way having SSL is a huge improvement for everyone. So its a win in my books.</p><p>Thanks for reading you pretty things!</p>
