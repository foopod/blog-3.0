<p>I hit this point in every project. I get to a stage of development where the project just isn’t fun anymore, its not that ball of excitement and new energy that it was when I started. I have to seriously knuckle down and do the hard yards.</p><p>The boring stuff, the stuff I have left until the last minute, the things I just don’t want to do. Here they are&hellip;</p><ul><li>Reworking the introduction/tutorial</li><li>Adding a pause menu</li><li>Upgrading ships aesthetics</li><li>Making the controls more intuitive</li><li>Making a press kit and video of the game</li><li>Buying iOS license and testing</li><li>Submitting for app reviews</li><li>Advertising and social media marketing</li></ul><p>I get to this stage with every project and every time the same result, I move on. I start something else that will never get finished. This is a lot of work, and none of it will be as fun or as interesting as the journey up until now.</p><p>But it will be a journey none the less and it is a path I am going to need to go down eventually. Up until now I have always told myself that the right project will come along and I will know, I will have the motivation and the determination to complete it, to go the extra mile and polish it.</p><p>This isn’t it though, I know this isn’t it, this game is one of the least inspired, least interesting and least enjoyable games I have made.</p><p>So why? What is the point of this blog post?</p><p>This is where I talk myself into doing this, even if I do put in all this extra effort and the game doesn’t do well, then at least I will have learned something. I will know a great deal more about the release process, marketing, advertising and monetising a game. That’s fantastic, but ultimately not the real reason I want to push on, I want a challenge and I want to prove to myself that I am capable of this.</p><p>Let’s do this!</p>
