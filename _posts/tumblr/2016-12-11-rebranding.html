<p>So lately I have been thinking about changing my image online.</p><p>This is mainly because the current image is very similar to your average techy joe, I wanted to differentiate myself from the crowd. I also wanted my new brand to be a bit more fun and enthusiastic to better suit the side of my brand in the game dev community.</p><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li>Similar enough that all my hard SEO work on “Jono Shields” wasn’t wasted.<br/></li><li>Fun and silly, but still clever. No sophistication required though.</li><li>Covers regular tech and game dev.</li><li>A clean aesthetic that is easily identifiable.</li></ul><p>This idea was actually taken from a friend (<a href="https://twitter.com/natsum77" target="_blank">Nat</a>) whose current role is Battle Mage at a fantastic VR Studio called <a href="https://www.conical.nz/" target="_blank">Conical</a>. Drawing inspiration from the fantasy realm, the role of battle mage insinuates a mastering of both the magical and physical aspects of battling. To be a technical artist/generalist you have to have mastery of both the practical sword (artistic utensil) and magical enchantments (source code).</p><p>Awesome right?!?!!</p><p>I figure that I am basically a Druid, I write powerful spells to achieve things that human abilities on their own can not. I have libraries dedicated to the spells I write, they are open and other wizards can use them and learn from them. I also carry with me my Tome (laptop) that allows me quick access to my spells.</p><p>With this in mind I started drawing a self portrait of myself in an adventure time style. I went with this aesthetic because it was clean and easy to reproduce and at I was heavily inspired by the character of Magic Man in the cartoon.</p><p>And my interpretation of Jono&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width="1204" data-orig-height="1606" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oi1et09OTy1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1204" data-orig-height="1606"/></figure><p>Next I had to learn how to use Inkscape so that I could vector my magnificent art piece so that it could be super lovely and clean.</p><figure data-orig-width="726" data-orig-height="968" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oi1ewmXXB11qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="726" data-orig-height="968"/></figure><p>Then I fleshed out a website using a template I borrowed from <a href="https://launchaco.com/build/" target="_blank">Launchaco</a>. Added some bright colours, a fun wizard quote and played with the layout a bit. I also made a couple of web service calls to grab my twitter follower count and public github repo count for some interesting up to date numbers.<br/></p><p>And here is the current state of <a href="https://druidjono.com" target="_blank">druidjono.com</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1408" data-orig-width="2826"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oi1j4lqaFz1qil7jn_540.png" data-orig-height="1408" data-orig-width="2826"/></figure><p>Todo:</p><ul><li>I want to make some more art to use as profile pics and such.<br/></li><li>Add meta tags to all the things.</li><li>Figure out a strategy to merge this with my current brand and social media accounts.</li></ul>
