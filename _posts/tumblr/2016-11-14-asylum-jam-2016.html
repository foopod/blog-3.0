<p>Hey TEAM!</p><p>In the weekend past my brother and I took part in <a href="https:www.asylumjam.com/" target="_blank">Asylum Jam</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="208" class="tmblr-full" data-orig-src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/2b5af54a0979fdfcc32a11b34aa6bc47/tumblr_inline_ognxcy2cVw1qil7jn_540.png"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ogra7foo9z1qil7jn_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="208" data-orig-src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/2b5af54a0979fdfcc32a11b34aa6bc47/tumblr_inline_ognxcy2cVw1qil7jn_540.png"/></figure><blockquote><div>Asylum Jam is a 48 hour long game jam where game developers are challenged to make a horror game and explore the genre without negative mental health or medical stereotypes.</div></blockquote><p>And we didn’t just make something stupid scary like some of the other (<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/obsession" target="_blank">seriously fucked up</a>) games I have made at game jams.</p><p>Instead we wanted to make something more meaningful, an experience that anyone playing could empathise with.</p><p>If you are interested you can check it out <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/antithesis/208143" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>So how did we do?</p><figure data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="144" class="tmblr-full" data-orig-src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/c884f61edd920f332823651d0d15efbb/tumblr_inline_ognxbjYVjl1qil7jn_540.jpg"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_ogra7f77jB1qil7jn_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="144" data-orig-src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/c884f61edd920f332823651d0d15efbb/tumblr_inline_ognxbjYVjl1qil7jn_540.jpg"/></figure><p>Not great. And here is why…</p><p><b>We prioritised gameplay and aesthetics over dialogue</b></p><p>This meant that our first iteration of the dialogue was also the last. Interactions were thusly short, not well thought out and overly simplified.</p><p><b>We lacked commitment </b></p><p>We still don’t have a narrative. We had an idea on day 2 to make the story about someone transitioning from man to woman. I fell in love with this idea immediately and wanted to pursue it further. But I was a wuss, I was scared that I would fuck up and misrepresent trans. I was also way too anxious to even ask people with more knowledge on twitter, this was super disappointing considering all the new and diverse people I met at MIGW.
</p><p>This is one of those moments of self reflection where I need to take a good look at myself and actively try harder if I want to improve.

As Liam says…

<b>Final thoughts</b>
</p><p>I feel you get as much out of game jams as you put in. It was a great learning experience and I got a lot out of using Unity for 2d and visual effects for the first time. And this is definitely something I would like to keep working on.</p>
