<p>As a programmer I am usually pretty limited making games by myself. And when I say limited I mean that I tend to use programmer art or get stuck in procedural generation rather than my actual game.</p><p>So when I arrived back from MIGW I decided that I was going to learn to draw. I found a nice set of lessons online and now 2 weeks later I have finished my first one.</p><p>I used <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Uncomfortable" target="_blank">/u/Uncomfortable</a>’s lessons on <a href="https://drawabox.com/" target="_blank">DrawABox</a> and would highly recommend them for anyone learning to draw. I found them especially awesome because of how methodical they were, super easy to follow and highlighting exactly what you want to learn from each stage of the lesson.</p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oh0tzwPWkr1qil7jn_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure><p>I am not going to bore you with the details but I will list some of the great things I’ve learned so far.</p><ul><li>Drawing from the shoulder</li><li>Drawing straight lines<br/></li><li>When drawing from perspective, the closer something is then the bigger it should be.</li></ul><p>This sounds really simple and kind of obvious, but there is a big difference between have the theoretical skills to notice something looks wrong and the practical skills to draw it right first time.</p><p>#learninglots</p><p>More and betterer art things to come&hellip;</p><p>Jono out.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/public/images/tumblr/tumblr_inline_oh0u649hS51qil7jn_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024"/></figure>
