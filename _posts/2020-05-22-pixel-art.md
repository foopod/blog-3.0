Recently I got into playing some old school videogames after making the arcade machine in the last post.

I fell in love with a couple of games in particular. Metroid: Zero Mission and Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. I hadn't ever got to play these games in the past, when I had my GameBoy Advance I was into Pokemon and boy did that take a lot of time.

A few years ago I was quite into Game Development, so I thought it might be fun to have a go making my own Metroidvania style game.

The first problem with this however was that I needed to make some sprites to use in the game. And I really wanted to do them myself, rather than using a spritepack made by someone else.

So here we go. My first sprite...

I started by following a tutorial (which annoyingly I can't find now). They had me draw a coffee cup, a skull and a person. They also recommended doing them in 16x16 and using a limited palette. These restrictions help to keep the style of pixel art, but also help with the learning process and let you focus on creativity elsewhere.

Here are the other three...

<img src="/public/images/pixel-art/skull.png" style="width:30%;image-rendering:crisp-edges"/>
<img src="/public/images/pixel-art/human.png" style="width:30%;image-rendering:crisp-edges"/>

I was pretty happy with these at the time tbh, but looking back at these now with more experience there are things I would do differently.

The next day I was feeling more adventurous and I really wanted to start on my game so I decided to just get started. I decided I wanted a 10-year-old girl to be the main character and I had a cleaning robot as the first "enemy".

<img src="/public/images/pixel-art/cleaner-bot.png" style="width:30%;image-rendering:crisp-edges"/>

The animation sucks, I know. I am still struggling with that tbh. Anyway, I think I need more practice. So on Day 3 I figure, stuff it, lets just do a whole big scene with tons of pixels.

This was a mistake.

I went too big. 320 * 160 to be exact. I don't know why. It's a dumb resolution. Bad idea is bad idea.

So the next day, back to tutorials. I found an awesome Youtube Channel that has tons of cool videos about pixel art, the dos and dont's. I highly recommend checking out [Brandon James Greer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC26K7LTSrJK0BPAUyyvtQg).

So the next piece was going to be 166 * 140 and I was only going to use 4 colours. These are the same resolution and number of colours as the original GameBoy.

Ah, much better. I was so happy with this one that I decided to try the same parameters last night.

Admittedly this one took me a lot longer. Maybe 2 hours. But it was worth it, I am super happy with how it came out. I definitely want to do more like it.
Next I want to try to expand my palette to 5 or 6 colours. I might also try to do the piece in grayscale and then colour it.
